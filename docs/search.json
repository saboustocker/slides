They also adapt their behavior in response to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrustworthiness\n\n\n\n\n\n\npeople trust AI less than humans in various contexts:\n\nAI is perceived to lack human abilities (Kirk and Givi 2025; Lefkeli, Karataş, and Gürhan-Canli 2024)\n\nwhich leads to perceived human decision-makers in the background, which in turn leads to perceived reduction in privacy and increase in feeling exploitet (Lefkeli, Karataş, and Gürhan-Canli 2024)\n\nAI is perceived as less private (Lefkeli, Karataş, and Gürhan-Canli 2024)\ntrust is decreased more if AI use is disclosed (Schilke and Reimann 2025; Kirk and Givi 2025) …\n… and people trust AI less when disclosing things (Lefkeli, Karataş, and Gürhan-Canli 2024)\n\nsome of these effects (e.g. algorithm aversion (Bigman 2022)) have been discussed extensively already\nPfeuffer et al.

The dominant paradigm over the last years has been this aversion vs. acceptance debate. I think we have considerably more upside, if we focus on a more up- or downstream variable along consumers’ journeys with AI (which can be a variable with impact on business or consumers’ self concept etc.).

Ambiguity: “Ambiguity is the type of meaning in which a phrase, statement, or resolution is not explicitly defined, making for several interpretations; others describe it as a concept or statement that has no real reference. A common aspect of ambiguity is uncertainty. It is thus an attribute of any idea or statement whose intended meaning cannot be definitively resolved, according to a rule or process with a finite number of steps.” Wikipedia\n\n\nDef. Origin Ambiguity: Origin ambiguity occurrs when the origin of something generated (text, speech, video, image, or otherwise) cannot be definively resolved*. (current working definition, definitely subject to change!)\n\n*The term origin ambiguity was chosen purposefully over authorship ambiguity, as current law in copyright does not intend for any AI tool to be able to author and therefore own content."

However, while these effects replicate outside of the lab to some extent, they are not as clear-cut as one would think, especially in situations where the risky situation has low winning probabilities or the situaiton pertains to losses. Furthermore, studies on external validity of the effect reveal mixed results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Sources on Ambiguity Aversion\n\n\n\n\n\n\nintroduced with the Ellsberg paradox in 1961\nin principle, people prefer the less ambiguous (read: uncertain) bet when provided with several options despite the choice being irrational (Machina and Siniscalchi 2014)\nThe concept of “ambiguity aversion” is not unanimously defined (Machina and Siniscalchi 2014), however in “traditional literature”, it most often means a preference for known risks over unknown risks(Trautmann and Van De Kuilen 2015)\n\nambiguity aversion is not universal: when introducing losses or lower likelihoods, ambiguity aversion is neutralized or even sought after (Kocher, Lahno, and Trautmann 2018) \\(\\rightarrow\\) see also: Kocher (2014), Binmore, stewart & Voorhoeve (2012), Kahn & Sarin (1997)\nmuch of this literature has focused on gain-frames (i.e. winning something)\nhowever, when the risky urn is a high risk urn, people seem to prefer the ambiguous urn (Curly & Yates, cited in Trautmann and Van De Kuilen (2015))\n“A significant number of studies found a complete reversal of ambiguity attitudes between the (modest‐likelihood) gain and loss domain, with ambiguity seeking for losses (Abdellaoui, Vossmann, & Weber, 2005; Baillon & Bleichrodt, 2012; Casey & Scholz, 1991; Chakravarty & Roy, 2009; Ho, Keller, & Keltyca, 2002; Kothiyal, Spinu, & Wakker, 2012).” (Trautmann and Van De Kuilen, 2015, p. 105) (pdf)\n\nthere are also studies on natural ambiguity (e.g. an American prefers to bet on the Dow Jones index, Trautmann and Van De Kuilen (2015))\n\nIn many of these events, it is shown that people feel more knowledgeable about the event(s) they are familiar with, and also assign higher subjective probabilities to them\n\nambiguity aversion is contested to be a higher-order effect in itself \\(\\rightarrow\\) ambiguity prudence and ambiguity temperance suggested as higher order effects (Baillon, Schlesinger, and Van De Kuilen 2018)\nambiguity aversion is also subclassified into absolute and relative ambiguity aversion (Baillon and Placido 2019)\nmany potential moderators are suggested for ambiguity attitudes:\n\ncomparative ignorance\npeer effects\ngroup decisions\nmarket interaction\nmany more (Trautmann and Van De Kuilen 2015)"

Ambiguity is also discussed as a purposeful marketing tactic (Kovacheva and Nikolova 2024).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmbiguity Aversion and Preference for Established Products\n\n\n\n\n\n\nambiguity aversion correlates with preference for more established / well known brands (Muthukrishnan, Wathieu, and Xu 2009)\ninduced ambiguity aversion also predicts preference for established products later on (Muthukrishnan, Wathieu, and Xu 2009)\nestablished brands sell stronger in situations where information is presented more ambiguously (Muthukrishnan, Wathieu, and Xu 2009)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmbiguity as a Moderator of Consumer Satisfaction\n\n\n\n\n\n\nambiguity in product quality (Yi 1993; Erdem and Keane 1996):\n\nproduct satisfaction = comparing expectations vs. reality \\(\\rightarrow\\) confirmation / disconfirmation paradigm (Yi 1993)\nambiguous product experience when the quality of the product is difficult to evaluate (Yi 1993)\nconsumers evaluate products based on a top-down (expectation and theorizing-driven) approach, when the quality is difficult to evaluate (i.e. ambiguous), but follow a data-driven bottom-up approach when the quality is unambiguous (and neglect expectations) (Yi 1993)\nambiguity about product quality is countered by Bayesian learning through the customer (buying different products and updating quality beliefs about \\(t-n\\) products). Structural modelling of this relationship is better than the Guadagni-Little model, especially the dynamic component appears valuable (Erdem and Keane 1996)\nwhen product quality is ambiguous, consumers rely more on advertising to inform themselves (Hoch and Ha 1986)\n\nthis effect is stronger when the ad is shown before showing the product compared to after, implying that there may be some sort of selective retreival of preceding information (Hoch and Ha 1986)\n\n\nambiguous marketing offers: ambiguous marketing offers are more effective under scarcity (Dhar et al., 1999), both resource scarcity and availability scarcity (Dhar et al., 1999; Fan et al., 2019)\nit also depends on how information is displayed: numeric cognition influences how ambiguity aversion manifests (Lenkovskaya and Sweldens 2025) (compression effect & left digit effect)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRole Ambiguity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDef. Role Ambiguity: occurs when a person feels that he or she lacks salient information needed to effectively enact his or her role Singh (1993), p. 12)\n\n\nhighly discussed construct in marketing & management [Singh (1993); Ho et al. (1997); and others]\n\n\\(\\rightarrow\\) not highly relevant to our project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmbiguous (uncertain) Marketing Tactics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsurprise boxes, buy and reveal deals, random price promotion, teaser ads\nsome classification frameworks, e.g. Kovacheva and Nikolova (2024):\n\nassortments: e.g. “loot boxes”\npromotional: e.g. “incomplete ads”\ninnovation: e.g. “mystery flavor coke”\n\nuncertainty marketing is used to cue consumers’ attention and interest (Kovacheva and Nikolova 2024)\nimportant for uncertainty marketing: the concealed information is non-negative, i.e. supposed to piqué someone’s interest, not worry them about the “catch”\nthe success of uncertainty marketing depends on many intra-personal characteristics\n\nstake: low vs. high\nopacity: low vs. high \\(\\rightarrow\\) stakes and opacity seem to be independent (Kovacheva and Nikolova 2024)\nthe concept of “lower stakes” is also discussed in other literature: Arrow (1965) for monetary stakes, Duke et al. (2018) in conjunction with uncertainty (uncertainty is less tolerable in high-stakes situations)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote Sabou\n\n\n\nWhile this is not necessarily what we are after, I think the insights regarding stakes could be interesting independent variables for us, i.e. does it matter how high-stakes something is for people to behave differently?"

    "text": "“Origin Ambiguity”\nWhile ambiguity in general has been discussed in various aspects (see sections above), origin ambiguity in terms of not knowing the source of a piece of information has hardly been discussed. There are somewhat related streams of research when looking at what purposefully obfuscating parts of informational material in advertising; when looking at deepfakes (although there is very little research on how people act when they believe something is a deepfake, only how they act when they know it), and (probably most relevant) the uncanny valley effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Origin) Ambiguity due to obfuscated Materials\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudies analyzing how cropped photos, etc. ellicit ambiguity\nPeracchio and Meyers-Levy (1994): visual ambiguity is caused by cropped photos\n\nwhen viewers lack sufficient motivation to parse cropped object, the product evaluations are based on some easily available heuristic (e.g. what the brand claims: “high quality jeans!”) (Peracchio and Meyers-Levy 1994)\n\nJohar (1995) finds similar effects for how the information of an ad is perceived under low- vs. high involvement\n\nit doesn’t matter if the important object itself is cropped, or if something else is cropped, the “cropping effect” (i.e. the ambiguity) is what makes people involved in processing given enough motivation (Peracchio and Meyers-Levy 1994)\n\nHagtvedt (2011) finds that incomplete typefaces (where letters are obfuscated or left out) ellicit lower trustworthiness, but higher perceived innovativeness\n\ntrustworthiness is related to clarity, whereas innovativeness is related to interestingness (\\(\\rightarrow\\) this could be something to explore for AI ads, although this effect here relates to letters of logos!)\n\nSevilla and Meyer (2020) find that concealing aspects of an aesthetic product in particular can heighten curiosity and ellicit positive associations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeepfakes\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndeepfakes are generally hard to detect for humans (see primarily Diel et al. (2024) for a meta-analysis showing that humans are practically as good as chance)\nthere is very little research on the consequences of ambiguity introduced through deepfakes, however:\n\nKöbis, Doležalová, and Soraperra (2021) find that people think a video is genuine rather than a Deepfake more often, and they are overconfident in their decisions\nWhittaker et al. (2025) show that perception of AI alteration (with deepfakes) decreases intention to purchase, and humanness of deepfake increases perceived authenticity (there is however no ambiguity in this study, as people knew what they were looking at)\nAhmed, Ng, and Bee (2023) look at the reasons why people share deepfake videos and identify FOMO, low cognitive ability, thinking that they are accurate (duh…)\na different study (Soto-Sanfiel, Angulo-Brunet, and Saha 2024) show that most people who do share deepfakes don’t do so for informational purposes, but for hedonic and entertainment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe uncanny valley Effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe uncanny valley hypothesis predicts a negative emotional appraisal of human replicas that appear or behave not quite human\n\n\n\nthe uncanny valley effect is perceived as highly unpleasant (Seyama and Nagayama 2007)\nsystematic literature reviews and meta-analyses show moderate support in favor of the following relevant effects:\n\neeriness in movement causes more distress than eeriness in still images (ka?, $?tsyriReviewEmpiricalEvidence2015)\n“categorization ambiguity” causes more distress (ka?, $?tsyriReviewEmpiricalEvidence2015)\nother studies summarize the ambiguity as “categorical uncertainty hypothesis” (Rau 2020). While there is substantial support in favor of these hypotheses, the uncanny valley effect and its causal mechanisms is still somewhat contested (see for example: (MacDorman and Chattopadhyay 2016))\n\nthere are attempts to quantify the predecessants and consequences of the uncanny valley effect, e.g. with a Bayesian framework (Moore 2012)\nwhen we are confronted with the eeriness of the uncanny valley, the amount of information processed is suppressed (Shin, Kim, and Biocca 2019); however this study looks more at the evaluation of the avatars, so maybe not 100% relevant to AI videos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Related Work\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile there is very little (maybe even no?) research on origin ambiguity in marketing, there are a few constructs somewhat relating to it, namely:\n\nauthenticity: Silver, Newman, and Small (2021) show that perceived inauthenticity increases outrage at brands. One core driver of perceived inauthenticity is deception, another one is adulteration (i.e. “enhancing”)\nobfuscation of information: only providing partial information on a product can go both ways. Research shows that products profiting most are those that have the least to hide (see box on obfuscation above)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote Jonas\n\n\n\nThis is interesting. What does feeling ambiguity related to content origin (or something else in AI realm) do with the consumer? Feeling unease, compensatory behavior (in other domain), outrage, what inferences do consumers draw under ambiguity?, how do consumers deal with ambiguity in general –&gt; we probably fall back on some heuristics, can we identify a new one here and any consequences?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdea Jonas\n\n\n\nHow many people are actually experiencing this kind of ambiguity? Under TikTok videos (define domain), we could probably find references to “Is this AI?” that would be perfect ambiguity markers. That is descriptive in a first step. But then what other variables could be interesting to look at here? What does this ambiguity do to the video’s performance in terms of engagment etc. (issue will be control group, so potentially just correlative). What are ambiguity markers that consumers mention, what makes them certain of the origin?\nWhere is the marketing relevance? We either do a pure consumer story (it does something with the consumer, wellbeing, self-concept etc.) or we extrapolate to companies that use AI for ads or so: What does ambiguity do with brand attitudes etc. (there is a gap here, I suppose)"

Not sure if we can or want to spin this thought furhter, but I think it could be an interesting angle.\n\n\n\n\nStream 3: Are ambiguity effects independent of source (written, spoken, image, video)?\n\nself-explanatory"

    "text": "Possible “Big Questions” to ask\n\nPlatform Effects\nThis would go less for or against a particular company, but platforms which are used by consumers to make purchase decisions. Here, we could explore how people treat ambiguity depending on platform rather than depending on product or brand. It would be a nice playing ground for comparing e.g. various modalities of origin ambiguity (written, image, video). It would also be interesting to see what effects the perception of the platform itself has (e.g. TikTok could be perceived as more entertainment and there is no expectation of informativeness, whereas a tech review blog is expected to be informative).\n\n\nPerceived Autonomy and Empowerment\nThis is my attempt at getting away from the “classics” of purchasing behavior, WTS, etc. It could be interesting how consumers perceive themselves when confronted with ambiguity? Do they feel “cheated” on, do they feel disempowered / taken advantage of, or do they not care at all?\n\n\nInformation Processing\nThis would tie into research on Deepfakes as well as Uncanny Valley Effects. We could have a look at how people process information depending on perceived ambiguity, and also if they engage with info more or less (e.g. do they click on “more info” or whatever, or do they do the opposite and click away / disregard as soon as they are not sure if it is AI or human anymore?)"

Another interesting aspect is the privacy-paradox specifically in terms of AI.
